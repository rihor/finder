# Explore The World

Simple page that uses the Google's Custom Search API.

I plan to use heroku, so I can have the page live so anyone can see without having trouble: https://www.heroku.com

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
You will need Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

This will make sure you have node installed
```
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

You need to install the project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Deployment

After installing that, you just need to:

```
npm run dev
```

Now that you have the project running.

Just type in your browser:

```
localhost:3333
```
